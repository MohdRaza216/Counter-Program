# Toggle Counter

A simple JavaScript-based counter with toggle, increment, decrement, reset, and random number functionality. This project allows users to manipulate a counter value dynamically with various controls while maintaining a clean and consistent UI.

## Features

- **Increment**: Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter value by 1.
- **Reset**: Resets the counter value to 0.
- **Toggle**: Clears the counter and stores its current value. Upon toggling back, it restores the stored value.
- **Random**: Generates a random number between 1 and 100 and displays it in the counter.
- UI layout remains consistent using a non-breaking space to prevent layout shifts when the counter is cleared.
